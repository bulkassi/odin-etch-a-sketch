# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project was done as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It contains a single page with etch-a-sketch minigame, where going over a grid square with a mouse colors the square (by increasing opacity). The color of each square is randomly generated.
The user is able to create a square grid from 1x1 to 100x100. 

The creation of this project allowed me to practice JavaScript basics (variables, operators, functions, loops and arrays) and basics of DOM manipulation and events (including event leverage), as well as revise Flexbox and knowledge of HTML and CSS.
